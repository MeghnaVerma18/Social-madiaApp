Technical Architecture:








The technical architecture of our social media app follows a client-server model, with a REST API used for the initial client-server connection. The frontend serves as the client and incorporates socket.io-client for establishing real-time communication with the backend server. The backend utilizes socket.io and Express.js frameworks to handle server-side logic and facilitate real-time messaging, post uploading, story uploading, and more.

The frontend includes the user interface and presentation layer, as well as the socket.io-client for establishing a persistent socket connection with the server. This enables real-time bidirectional communication, allowing for instant updates and seamless interaction between users.

Authentication is handled through the REST API, which securely verifies user credentials and provides access tokens or session cookies for subsequent requests. Once authenticated, the client establishes a socket connection with the backend to enable real-time features.

Real-time messaging is facilitated through the socket.io library, enabling instant exchange of messages between users. Users can engage in chats with there friends, sharing text, emojis, images, etc., in real-time.

Uploading posts and stories is also supported through the socket connection. Users can create and upload posts or stories, including text, images, videos, or a combination of media. The server receives and processes these uploads, ensuring they are associated with the correct user and made available for other users to view and interact with in real-time.

The backend utilizes Express.js to handle the REST API endpoints, routing requests to the appropriate controllers and services. User data, including profiles, posts, stories, and other relevant information, is stored and retrieved from a database such as MongoDB, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of data.

Together, the frontend, backend, REST API, socket.io, Express.js, and database (e.g., MongoDB) form a comprehensive technical architecture for our social media app. This architecture enables real-time messaging, seamless post and story uploading, authentication, and secure data storage, providing users with a dynamic and interactive social media experience.
